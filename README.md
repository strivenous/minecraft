# A layman's guide to modified Minecraft (mods).
### One ***very*** simplified introduction to Minecraft mods and its various mechanics.

This is a simple guide/intro to modded Minecraft, to some people it might seem difficult or some don't even know about *vital* things for a decent gameplay experience.
Soon suggestions will be opened, and YOU will be able to send your own suggestion for things to be added into this simple markdown-style manual. This may include different quirks of modded Minecraft, including from server administration/development, to performance and simple definitions, excuse the (hopefully, quite minimalistic) communicative barrier, as I am not natively English.
